# Bitcoin Ticker ðŸ¤‘

## My Goal

The objective of this project is to learn about Cupertino and Material Widgets in parallel and providing a different user interface depending on the platform i.e. Android or iOS.


## What I will create

I am going to make a crypto currency price checking app which will be able to monitor your bitcoin investents on the move!

## What I have learned

- How to use the DropdownButton Widget from Material design.
- How to loop through code using Dart for and for-in loops.
- How to use Cupertino Widgets in your app.
- How to check the platform your app is being run on to customise the UI for that platform.
- Revise previous concepts by completing the challenges.
